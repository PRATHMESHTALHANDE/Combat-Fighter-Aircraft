# Combat-Fighter-Aircraft
I have created SQL Analysis project on Combat Fighter Aircraft and Data for aircraft fighter jet collected from ChatGPT.  My Database have 28 metadata for detailed evaluation of fighter jets. This evaluation is for educational purpose and strictly based on the information I got for combat fighter aircraft from ChatGPT. In order to fetch result you have to upload excel csv same database in SQL workbench with table name fightjet.
